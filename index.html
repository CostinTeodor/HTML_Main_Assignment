                <strong>First things first,</strong>
                I like playing video games as they relax me and distract me
                when I am too stressed over different problems.
                Clearing my mind helps me find solutions to problems really fast.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started playing <strong> League of Legends</strong>
                (commonly used as <strong>League</strong>) in a summer,
                6 years ago. Even though I did not improve that much, I kept playing
                it for fun, along with friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding <strong>Osu!</strong>, I started playing it in school, as it was installed
                on those pc's and I always loved rythm-related games.
                When I really got into it, I started getting better and better,
                but lost a lot of time in the front of the monitorðŸ˜….
            </p>
            <p>
                The last video game in the list is <strong>Raft</strong>, a game that I love
                and I finished several times. It is a survival game, where you
                get lost on the ocean and need to gather resources, build and the ultimate
                goal si to find the 'Utopia'.
            </p>

        <div id="boardGames"> </div>
        <p>
            <strong>The board games</strong> are the real deal.
            I started playing chess, backgammon, mill and lots of other classics
            since I was 4-5 year-old and I never stopped loving them.
            Besides the classics, I got to play monopoly, monopoly
            cheaters edition, catan and much more.
            The reason I love playing board games the most is that
            you get to spend time with friends/family and have fun at
            the same time (also I am very lucky and almost always win).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cards Against Humanity</strong> is one of the most recent card game
            I bought, but it also is one of the best, since even 10 people
            can play it, and there are a lot of funny cards that fit
            everytime.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Catan</strong> is also a very cool board game and
            it is very competitive. The main 'skill' required for this
            one is luck, as everyone can get resources each turn, if they
            have a settlement on the number shown on the dice.

                Finally, got to <strong>Biking</strong>.
                This is one of my oldest passion I still have.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I am not that passioned about the technical part,
                I love riding the bike. For a very long time, I biked
                til the other corner of the country everday at 4:00 AM
                just to buy some Apple juice from a SuperMarket there.
                Anywhere I wanted to go, I got on my bike and started
                pedalling.

            <p>
                A few years ago, I wanted to start reading a book which's
                title transmits somethning to me. I almost couldn't find
                anything to confer me this effect, but I found
                <strong> Ender's Game</strong> on internet one day. Couldn't find any
                physical book, so I read it online. With every chapter passed,
                I fell more in more in love with this book. It had
                anything I was looking for at that time. It's regarding
                this genius boy that has been borned because the government
                ordered so and he's been bullied because he was considered special.
                Would like to write more about it, but wouldn't like to spoil it.

        <div id="George">
            <p>
                <strong>George and the secret key of the Universe</strong> was
                a book that I started reading because my English teacher asked me to
                in 7th grade.
                It was an easy book and informative regarding the universe.
                Now that I think about it, it was like a cartoon in a book.
                There was this kid whose parents were anti-technology and he really
                wanted a laptop and their neighnours were a scientist with his daughter.
                In the end, he won a contest with a laptop as a reward, with
                help from his neighbours.
            </p>
            <p>
                It doesn't seem such interesting, but that's because
                I missed the best parts in the book.
                George gets in the universe using Cosmo, a
                talking computer and there are a lot of adventures
                that I will let you explore, if you want to read the book.
