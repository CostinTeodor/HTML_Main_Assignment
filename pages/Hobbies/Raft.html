            Raft is an open world survival video game developed 
            by Swedish developer Redbeet Interactive, and published 
            by Axolot Games.

            The game is played from the first-person perspective and 
            can be played either in the single-player or multiplayer
            mode. With the latter, the server is automatically provided
            by the game and the game takes place in co-op mode.

            After a world is created, the player starts on a 2x2 raft in 
            the middle of an ocean. The player starts only with a hook 
            that they can aim and throw to catch barrels, wood, palm
            fronds, plastic, crates, and other objects out of the water.
            The player can leave the raft and collect things while
            swimming, but must be careful as the raft is always moving
            due to the continuous ocean current. The player can also 
            be attacked or killed by sharks that are always swimming 
            around the raft. These sharks will also occasionally
            attack corners of the raft, destroying parts of it. 
            Using a crafting system, the player can use the collected
            materials to assemble and research new items and to 
            expand and improve the raft. For example, tools, weapons
            and nets can be manufactured. These can be used control
            and guide the raft, increase the size and stability of
            the raft, and defend the raft from the sharks.
