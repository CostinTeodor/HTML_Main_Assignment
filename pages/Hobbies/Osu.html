            Osu! is a singleplayer rythm game, but it also has a multiplayer
            gamemode, in which you compete with other players on the same
            song.
        </p>
        <p>
            On Osu! you can find almost any song ever written,
            whether it is an anime intro or a rap song. There are different
            types of maps for the same song, so the posibilities to play
            a different style on the same song are almost limitless.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game is played by mouse/keyboard or even a drawing tablet
            (which is the most used) and it consists in clicking the right rythm
            circles at the right time and getting a high accuracy. It 
            sounds simple, but it is pretty difficult.
