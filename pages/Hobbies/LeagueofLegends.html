        <p>League of Legends is a popular game that was developed in 2009
            by a company called <strong>Riot Games</strong>. In the game, two
            teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each
            team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the
            ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with
            unique abilities and differing styles of play.
