            Catan is a board game that is played in 3-4 players.
            Each player has 2 settlements and 2 roads at the start, that
            they can place on the map to gather resources when the dice
            are rolled.

        </p>
        <p>
            Each game, the map is different, as the pieces are placed randomly,
            face down.
            Each settlement is considered 1 point, and the first player to
            get 10 points wins.
