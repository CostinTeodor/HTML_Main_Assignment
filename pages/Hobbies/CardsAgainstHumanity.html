            Cards Against Humanity is a board game in which you have
            to gather points by replying to the card in the middle of 
            the table with the funniest card you have in hand. 
            The one who chooses the funniest card out of all is called
            the Card Czar and it rotates from player to player.
        </p>

            The cards in this game are also gathered from special
            card packs that can be(and usually are) not family-friendly.
